We briefly mentioned code frameworks today, so I'll include a brief summary here. You can use whatever code you want (including what you wrote during the semester), but there are a few established libraries out there. Which one is the best depends on usecase since all of them have some limitations in terms of what's easy to implement. Notable are CleanRL (single-file implementations of algorithms you can copy and change: https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/tree/master), StableBaselines3 (good general-purpose library with different algorithms: https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/quickstart.html) and ray's RLLib (library with several advanced algorithms, but hard to hack: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/getting-started.html). If you plan to use any of them, check carefully beforehand how easy it is to use for you purpose and then stick with one framework. Results and hyperparameters don't always transfer, so switching code will see you start from scratch!
